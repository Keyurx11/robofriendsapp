Install the dependencies by running the following command:
`npm install`

Start the development server by running the following command:

The app should now be running on your local machine at http://localhost:3000.

The app displays a list of robot friends, each with a name and a profile picture. You can search for a specific robot by typing a name into the search bar. The list of robot friends will be filtered to show only those that match the search query.

If you want to make changes to the app or add new features, you can do so by editing the files in the src directory. Make sure to test your changes to ensure that they do not break the app.
